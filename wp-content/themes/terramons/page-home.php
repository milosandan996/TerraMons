                        The living and sleeping areas are done in a mix of
                        attractive and boho style, with refined contrasts
                        in relation to the glass surfaces that surround the
                        entire interior. The apartment is dominated by 
                        various shades and textures of brown color, made
                        of high-quality oak wood material. Glass elements
                        placed over each TV give the space layers and 
                        reflections, so together with the LED elements that
                        dominate throughout the apartment, they make the 
                        entire ambiance luxurious and well-lit. We wanted
                        to bring in a modern element but also to retain 
                        the spirit of tradition and wooden elements that 
                        adorn the <a href="https://sr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%97%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8%D0%B1%D0%BE%D1%80">Zlatibor</a> mountain. Modern furniture, 
                        pared-down lines, and pronounced contrasts make 
                        this apartment attractive and bold, while also 
                        being adaptive to the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/43%C2%B043'24.5%22N+19%C2%B041'59.0%22E/@43.723463,19.699717,17z/data=!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d43.7234722!4d19.6997222?hl=sr"> location</a>.
